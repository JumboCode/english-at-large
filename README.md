# Welcome to English at Large

Hello and welcome! We're going to have a great time developing this project over the next year. Follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

First, after cloning the repository, run `npm i` to install all packages. This sets up the infrastructure and everything you need for the site to work and stores it on a folder called `node_modules`.

You'll also want some packages on VSCode:

- Live Share
- Simple React Snippets
- ESLint
- Prettier - Code Formatter
- Prettier ESLint

Run `npx prisma generate` to generate your Prisma Client. You'll need to run this if the schema gets updated, but Clarence will let you know when that happens.

## Development

To actually run the site, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## Deployment

We have a CI/CD pipeline that will auto-deploy your changes to our website every time you push a change to your remote branch. This deployment pipeline will "lint" your code. This means that it will perform type-checking and throw compiler errors if incompatible types are found.

This means you *need to have ESLint installed and configured* to avoid these errors. 

Before pushing, run `npm run build` to try to build the website locally. It will throw errors if something is wrong and notify you where that error is. This will save me a headache when reviewing code later :D

## Practices and Techniques:

These are some of the practices and style guidelines to maintain for consistency in this codebase.

### Components

To add a new component, create a new file in components that is the name of the component. Then define the types for the component at the top of the component, then use it to type the component's `props`. To use each field of the props within the component, destructure the `props` field.

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  prop1: prop1Type;
  prop2: prop2Type;
}

/**
 * Use JSDoc styling right above the header if this component is important.
 * z`
 * Also, the name of the component should capitalized, and the file should be the same. 
 * */
const Component = (props: ComponentProps) => {
  const { prop1, prop2 } = props;
}
```

### Props

Props are a very powerful method of transferring information between components. However, it can be quite tricky to wrap your head around it.

Here's some tips and tricks:
- You can pass in functions (any by extension, components) as props! This is super useful, as you can pass in `setState` functions from a parent component into its child. However, it's good practice to wrap these functions in a `useCallback` before passing it in as a prop. This prevents the function from being re-rendered and improves efficiency.
- Try to avoid "prop drilling." This is when you pass a single prop from a parent down many layers of components. This leads to code that is hard to debug since you'll need to test every layer where it's failing. Usually there are better solutions, like a context or state management tool.
- "Memoize" props involving complex data with many fields, such as a `Book`. Wrap it in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- For consistency, use enums. This will make it slightly more of a pain in the ass when checking for type safety, but it improves readability and prevents bugs from typos which is a lot more sustainable down the line.


### Conditional Rendering 

Use it when you can, rather than multiple `return` statements that can be hard to track. If there are many conditions, then either use a switch statement or bite the bullet and use a bunch of ternary operators. Track each state or condition with an enum. If you want to render nothing, then use `null` as the falsy value.
```typescript

// use null instead of an empty div, etc.
{ condition ? <div>"render if true"</div> : null}

```
